    "Elysia Thunderscribe": "A Human female Wizard: With expressive, indigo eyes full of knowledge and secrets, Her charcoal-black hair is streaked with silver and often loosely tied in a braid, shimmering with astral sparkles whenever she casts a spell. Even though she is in her late twenties, the look in her eyes is ageless, indicating wisdom far beyond her years. Her slender figure is draped in a celestial-blue robe adorned with runic symbols, the fabric shimmering as if dusted with stardust. She carries an ornate staff, topped with a crystal orb pulsating with arcane energy. Though her delicate features might deceive some, her aura emanates formidable power, proof of her prowess in the arcane arts."
